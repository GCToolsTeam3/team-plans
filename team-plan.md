Things We Need To Accomplish It?

Rick says: I don't fully understand what is expected from this one. Maybe a quick brainstorm to help us flush out the ideas and what we want to accomplish? I'm not clear on what the outcome would be, or how we could get there.

Things We Need To Accomplish It?
Time and 'aha' moments

Ideas and Notes?
Can't do too much in the time frame, But I think we can solve the unhelpful error message you get when searching gorups you aren't a member of. 




4-Tagging (Note - Rick M really want to do this, and I think it can be done quite easily)

Things We Need To Accomplish It?

Testing server - I have a local one, but the remote one won't work for me. So at least I can test locally and send a pull request to the main GCConnex repo if we get it fixed. 

Ideas and Notes?
Autcomplete.js

append new div when the @ symbol is typed 

with unique ID. Place the autocomplete 

dropdown on the new DIV, in the text the 

user is currently typing. 

#mentions-popup is current.

tions/autocomplete.js

Or use JQUERY ui position utility to move 

the existing diff after document.load.

or load div on@, use jquery position linked 

to mouse?

Add mp3 option with HTML5 player
