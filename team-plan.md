<h3>Things We Need To Accomplish It?</h3>
<p>Rick says: I don't fully understand what is expected from this one. Maybe a quick brainstorm to help us flush out the ideas and what we want to accomplish? I'm not clear on what the outcome would be, or how we could get there.  </p>

  Ideas and Notes?
  Can't do too much in the time frame, But I think we can solve the unhelpful error message you get when searching gorups you aren't a member of.</p>
<h2>4-Tagging (Note - Rick M really want to do this, and I think it can be done quite easily)</h2>

<h3>Things We Need To Accomplish It?</h3>
<p> Testing server - I have a local one, but the remote one won't work for me. So at least I can test locally and send a pull request to the main GCConnex repo if we get it fixed.</p>
<h3>Ideas and Notes?</h3>
<p>Autcomplete.js
  
  append new div when the @ symbol is typed 
  
  with unique ID. </p>
<p>Place the autocomplete 
  
  dropdown on the new DIV, in the text the 
  
  user is currently typing. 
  
  #mentions-popup is current.  </p>
<p>https://github.com/GCToolsTeam3/gcconnex/blo
  
  b/gcconnex/mod/mentions/views/default/js/men
  
  tions/autocomplete.js</p>
<p>Or use JQUERY ui position utility to move 
  
  the existing diff after document.load.
  
  or load div on@, use jquery position linked 
  
  to mouse?  </p>
<p>http://api.jqueryui.com/position/
  
  
  Also like Richards idea of autoscroll.</p>

<h3>Ideas and Notes?</h3>
<p>This is an important UI feature that is missing. Should be easy to fix. </p>
